This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles:  failure to set the WORKDIR before attempting to execute commands within the container. The original Dockerfile attempts to run a python script with a missing WORKDIR which leads to the error.  The solution demonstrates the correct use of WORKDIR to specify the location of the script.
